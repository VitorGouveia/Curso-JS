# SchoolClub

Brainstorm
3 feeds

each feed is basically the same but with different purposes
of course some features are specific to a feed, like meetings for the study feed

my goal is to make this the stackoverflow of studying
ability to listen to podcasts
_amazing_ group discoverability
task management
everything that a student needs

focus mode where you can configure your own pomodoro clock

- [ ] perguntas e respostas, Q&A, reddit-like, upvotes, downvotes, live discussions, custom emojis/stickers to use, awards, audio rooms, etc

- [ ] brainly like, perguntas e respostas mais diretas, entre professores e alunos

- [ ] for school, meetings, video and audio rooms, chats and groups, teams/discord/slack-like
